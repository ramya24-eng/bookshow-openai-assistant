<h2>OpenAI Chatbot<h2>
  
<h4>This project demonstrates a simple chatbot using OpenAI's GPT model. The bot can respond to text input dynamically, leveraging OpenAI's API.</h4>

<h3>Generating OpenAI API key</h3>
   <h4>To use OpenAI's API, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:</h4>

   <h4>Go to OpenAI's platform and log in or sign up.</h4>
   <h4>Navigate to the API section and copy your API key.</h4>
   <h4>Create a file called .env in the root of your project directory (or set the environment variable in your terminal):</h4>
   <h4>Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable directly in the terminal (for temporary use):
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here</h4>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Running the Chatbot
The chatbot script will take input from the user and return a response from OpenAI's GPT model.</h4>
